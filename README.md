# Blynk-Water-level-sensor
A project i saw on instructables that i changed a bit to suit my needs

I currently have a park assist sensor mounted through a hole in the top of or borehole JOJO tank that reads the distance from the top of the water tank to the waterlevel. The sensor then works out how full the water tank is and the data is sent over WIFI to our local Blynk server. This makes it easy to check the water level at any time any where in my cellphone using the free Blynk App.
